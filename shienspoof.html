                            <p><strong>Shein Claims:
                            </strong> “We have created the SHEIN Responsible Sourcing (SRS) evaluation system and conduct regular supplier audits. SHEIN's Responsible Sourcing Program assigns grades of A, B, C, D and Zero Tolerance Violations (ZTVs) to factories based on audit results. Examples of ZTVs include forced labor, serious environmental pollution, severe health and safety violations, and underage labor. SHEIN provides capacity building training to suppliers to support the remediation of ZTV and other major Code violations. Should suppliers fail to remediate violations within the allowed timeframe (immediately in severe cases, such as underage labor), we take further action, including termination.” </p>
                                <p1>
                                <strong>In Reality:</strong> In June 2022, videos circulating on social media claimed that Shein workers were embedding messages in the garments they manufactured, with one tag supposedly containing the plea "need your help" within the care instructions. Shein responded to these allegations through a TikTok video, asserting that it was a misunderstanding and emphasizing their "strict code of conduct for suppliers, which prohibits forced labor." According to Shein, the intention behind the "need your help" message was merely to prompt customers to use fabric softener when washing the garment to improve its texture. Despite the company's explanation, commenters remain skeptical, questioning the honesty of the company and urging the release of videos showcasing the actual working conditions instead of a brief explanatory video.

                                <strong>In Reality:</strong> In October 2022, an undercover investigation by Channel 4 and The i newspaper in the UK uncovered that Shein employees work seven days a week, receiving a modest base salary of only $556 per month to produce 500 clothing items daily. This translates to a mere two cents per item produced. Some workers, particularly females, had to wash their hair during lunch breaks due to the lack of time after enduring 18-hour workdays. </p>

                                <strong>In Reality:</strong> Most of Shein's products are dispatched from warehouses located in China, contributing significantly to a substantial carbon footprint. Presently, China stands as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gasses, surpassing the combined emissions of all developed nations. Despite the United States being Shein's primary market, the company ships its products to a total of 220 countries worldwide. </p>

                                    <strong>In Reality:</strong> Out of the 52,000 dresses currently featured on the site, only 64 are reportedly crafted from recycled polyester. The starting price for these alternatives is $4, a notable contrast to sustainable brands where options rarely fall below $50. This pricing dynamic raises skepticism about the true eco-friendliness of these Shein options.

                                    The packaging materials used by Shein have become a topic of online conversation. Every item is individually enclosed in a plastic zip-top bag.

                                <strong>In Reality: </strong> The second most environmentally detrimental sector, surpassed only by the oil and gas industry, is fast fashion. This industry contributes to 20% of global wastewater and 10% of carbon emissions. The immense quantities of water and energy required for producing millions of pieces annually are undeniably substantial. Even if Shein has implemented or plans to implement rigorous measures to diminish waste and energy usage, achieving sustainability becomes implausible given the exceptionally high production rate. In essence, Shein is fundamentally unsustainable.
